# Iris Classification with SVM

This project implements a machine learning model to classify the Iris flower species using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The Iris dataset, which contains measurements for three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), is used for this classification task.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- %matplotlib inline `

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/doreenasiimwe/iris-classification-svm.git
cd iris-classification-svm
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python iris_classification.py
The script will load the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train the SVM model, and output the accuracy of the model.

Model Performance
The model achieved an accuracy of 96.67% on the test data. This high accuracy indicates that the SVM model is effective in classifying the species of Iris flowers based on the given features.

Visualizations
The project includes visualizations that display the dimensions of the Iris Setosa flower, providing insights into its characteristics compared to the other species.
